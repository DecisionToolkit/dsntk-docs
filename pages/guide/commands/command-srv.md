# Serving DMNâ„¢ models

The core function of the <DsntkName/> is serving <Dmn/> models.
The <Dmn/> specification precisely defines XML interchange format for decision models.
XML files containing decision models are loaded and processed by <DsntkName/> server and exposed
as a set of [JSON API](https://jsonapi.org) endpoints.
Each endpoint represents a single invocable defined in the decision model.
Calling an endpoint is equivalent to executing a decision, business knowledge model
or decision service.

To explain in details, how to run and use the <DsntkName/> server (a.k.a. _DMN runtime_),
we assume that <DsntkName/>'s built-in examples are saved in **examples** directory and the current
directory contains only **examples** directory. When typed in terminal:

```shell
$ ls
```

The output should be:

```ansi
[34;1mexamples[0m
```

## Running a server

To run <DsntkName/> as a server, type the following command:

```shell
$ dsntk srv
```

Expected output should look like this:

```ansi
[32;1mFound 1 model.[0m
[32;1mLoaded 1 model.[0m
[32;1mDeployed 1 invocable.[0m
[34;1mdsntk [33;1m0.0.0.0:22022[0m
```

&#8203;<DsntkName/> server is started. This server accepts connections from all available network
interfaces **0.0.0.0** (default) and listens on port **22022** (default).
During startup, the <DsntkName/> server scans the current working directory
(default) and its subdirectories, and searches for decision models stored in XML
files having **.dmn** extension.

In our example - during scanning - the <DsntkName/> server has found **examples** directory
containing one subdirectory named **e2** with decision model file named **e2.dmn**. This file was loaded
and one invocable was deployed, a decision named **Greeting&nbsp;Message**.

This invocable can be evaluated by calling the following endpoint:

```text
examples/e2/io/dsntk/2_0001/compliance-level-2-test-0001/Greeting%20Message
```

The list of all deployed invocables with endpoint names can be displayed during server startup
by specifying the option **-v** or **--verbose**, like shown below:

```shell
$ dsntk srv -v
```
```text
Found 1 model.
Loaded 1 model.
Deployed 1 invocable.

Deployed invocables:
  examples/e2/io/dsntk/2_0001/compliance-level-2-test-0001/Greeting%20Message

dsntk 0.0.0.0:22022
```

## Evaluating the invocable

Having the ^dt server started, the deployed invocable can be evaluated by calling an endpoint
with required input data, using [**curl**](https://curl.se) for example:

```shell
$ curl -s -d "{\"Full Name\":\"John Doe\"}" \
       -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
       -X POST http://0.0.0.0:22022/evaluate/examples/e2/io/dsntk/2_0001/compliance-level-2-test-0001/Greeting%20Message
```
```text
{"data":"Hello John Doe"}
```

The ^dt version of a [hello world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Hello,_World!%22_program)
program could look like this:

```shell
$ curl -s -d "{\"Full Name\":\"world\"}" \
       -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
       -X POST http://127.0.0.1:22022/evaluate/examples/e2/io/dsntk/2_0001/compliance-level-2-test-0001/Greeting%20Message
```
```text
{"data":"Hello world"}
```

## Endpoint names

The common endpoint for evaluating invocables exposed by the <DsntkName/> server
is named `evaluate`.

The full URL of the endpoint is composed of the following parts:

- protocol:

  `http://` or `https://`

- host address:

  `0.0.0.0` or `127.0.0.1` or `my.domain.com`

- common endpoint name:

  `evaluate`

- directory names where the file containing the DMNâ„¢ model was found during scanning:

  `examples/e2`

- model namespace converted to RDNN-like path:

  `io/dsntk/2_0001/compliance-level-2-test-0001`

- invocable name:

  `Greeting Message`

All parts put together give the following URL of the endpoint:

`http://127.0.0.1:22022/evaluate/examples/e2/io/dsntk/2_0001/Greeting%20Message`

::: info NOTE

While not all characters are legal in URLs, there is `%20` between `Greeting` and `Message`,
which represents a space in [percent-encoding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percent-encoding).
See [RFC3986](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3986#section-2.4) for more details.
