# Serving DMNâ„¢ models

The core functionality of the <DsntkName/> is serving <Dmn/> models.
The <Dmn/> specification precisely defines XML interchange format for decision models.
XML files containing decision models are loaded and processed by <DsntkName/> server and exposed
as a set of [JSON API](https://jsonapi.org) endpoints.
Each endpoint represents a single invocable defined in the decision model.
Calling an endpoint is equivalent to executing a decision, business knowledge model
or decision service.

To explain in details, how to run and use the <DsntkName/> server, we assume
that the built-in examples are already saved in the **examples** directory
and the current directory contains only the **examples** directory
(see [Saving examples](command-exs.md) for details).

```shell
$ ls
```

The expected output should be:

```ansi
[34;1mexamples[0m
```

## Running a server

To run <DsntkName/> as a server, type the following command:

```shell
$ dsntk srv
```

Expected output should look like this:

```ansi
[32;1mFound 1 model.[0m
[32;1mLoaded 1 model.[0m
[32;1mDeployed 1 invocable.[0m
[34;1mdsntk [33;1m0.0.0.0:22022[0m
```

&#8203;<DsntkName/> server is started. This server accepts connections from all available network
interfaces **0.0.0.0** and listens on port **22022**. During startup, the <DsntkName/> server
scans the current directory with all its subdirectories, and searches for decision models
stored as XML files having **.dmn** extension.

In our example, during directory scanning, the <DsntkName/> server has found the **examples** directory
containing one subdirectory named **e2** with decision model file named **e2.dmn**. This file was loaded,
and one invocable was deployed, a decision named **Greeting&nbsp;Message**.

This invocable can be evaluated by calling the following endpoint:

```ansi
http://0.0.0.0:22022/evaluate/examples/e2/io/dsntk/2_0001/compliance-level-2-test-0001/Greeting%20Message
```

To stop the <DsntkName/> server, press **Ctrl+C**.

The list of all deployed invocables with the endpoint names can be displayed during server startup
by specifying the option **-v** or **--verbose**, like shown below:

```shell
$ dsntk srv -v
```

```ansi
[32;1mFound 1 model.[0m
[32;1mLoaded 1 model.[0m
[32;1mDeployed 1 invocable.[0m

[33;1mDeployed invocables:[0m
  [35;1mexamples[0m/[34;1me2/io/dsntk/2_0001[0m/[36;1mcompliance-level-2-test-0001[0m/[32;1mGreeting%20Message[0m

[34;1mdsntk [33;1m0.0.0.0:22022[0m
```

## Evaluating invocables

Having the <DsntkName/> server started, the deployed invocable can be evaluated by calling
its endpoint with required input data, using, e.g. [**curl**](https://curl.se):

```shell
$ curl -s -d '{"Full Name":"John Doe"}' \
       -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
       -X POST http://0.0.0.0:22022/evaluate/examples/e2/io/dsntk/2_0001/compliance-level-2-test-0001/Greeting%20Message
```

The expected output should be:

```ansi
{"data":"Hello John Doe"}
```

The <DsntkName/>'s version of a [hello world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Hello,_World!%22_program)
program could look like this:

```shell
$ curl -s -d '{"Full Name":"world"}' \
       -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
       -X POST http://127.0.0.1:22022/evaluate/examples/e2/io/dsntk/2_0001/compliance-level-2-test-0001/Greeting%20Message
```

Expected output:

```text
{"data":"Hello world"}
```

## Endpoint names

The common endpoint for evaluating invocables exposed by the <DsntkName/> server
is named `evaluate`.

The full URL of the endpoint is composed of the following parts:

- protocol:

  `http://` or `https://`

- host address:

  `0.0.0.0` or `127.0.0.1` or `my.domain.com`

- common endpoint name:

  **`evaluate`**

- directory names where the file containing the DMNâ„¢ model was found during scanning:

  `examples/e2`

- model namespace converted to RDNN-like path:

  `io/dsntk/2_0001/compliance-level-2-test-0001`

- the name of the invocable:

  `Greeting Message`

All parts put together give the following URL of the endpoint:

`http://127.0.0.1:22022/evaluate/examples/e2/io/dsntk/2_0001/Greeting%20Message`

::: info NOTE

While not all characters are legal in URLs, there is `%20` between `Greeting` and `Message`,
which represents a space in [percent-encoding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percent-encoding).
See [RFC3986](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3986#section-2.4) for more details.
